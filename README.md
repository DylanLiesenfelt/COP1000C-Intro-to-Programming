# Broward College COP1000C - Intro to Programming in Python 
* Final Grade A
* Thoughts: I took this fully online, very very very basic, ie what are data types, variables, print formatting/concatenation, basic arthmetic, basics of using functions, if/else statments, basics of loops, that was about it a very begginer friendly class and really easy.
